# ValorantAbilitiesMap

This is a python application for Valorant Agent abilities.  

### This project has 3 goals:
- Make it easy to view Agent ability setups
- Be up-to-date with the information
- Collaborate with the community for new and updated information

### Currently the project only supports Sova, but here is the list of things I will be working on next:
- Pulling images from S3 instead of being built into the app(Currently being worked on)
- Adding an agent screen at the beginning, to support more than just Sova(This will be next)
- Creating collaborative documents for the community to give suggestions for ability setups
- Creating a web application out of this, to make access much easier

This is an open source project, and if you would like to contribute, feel free to message me on Reddit /u/Sec-Student
