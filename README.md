# ValorantAbilitiesMap

This is a python application for Valorant Agent abilities.  The pictures are meant for a quick glance at the setups without having to watch the video.  This application is still a work in progress, and is by no means a finished product.  Make sure to check back shortly for major updates.  When location updates are made for maps, you will not need to redownload the application, but when new maps or agents are added you will.

If you have any issues please report them in the issues section of this Github page.  Some sub-par antivirus programs will flag the executable release as a virus due to pyInstaller.  I am currently working on this issue.

Current Release: https://github.com/Devin-Marks/ValorantAbilitiesMap/releases/tag/1

### This project has 3 goals:
- Make it quick and easy to view Agent ability setups
- Be up-to-date with the information
- Collaborate with the community for new and updated information

Currently the project only supports Sova, I will be adding Split in the next couple days and I am looking for setups for all Agents on all maps, so please PM me on Reddit if you would like to contribute to that.

### List of future Features:
- Pulling images from S3 instead of being built into the app(Completed)
- Adding an agent screen at the beginning, to support more than just Sova(Next Release)
- Creating and adding the files for other agents(Will need community support with this one)
- Creating collaborative documents for the community to give suggestions for ability setups
- Creating a web application out of this, to make access much easier

This is an open source project, and if you would like to contribute, feel free to message me on Reddit /u/Sec-Student

Currently there are no comments in the code, I will be working on that this week.  Ive only been working on this for a couple days.
